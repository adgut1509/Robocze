# **Overview of Confluence, JIRA, and MadCap Flare**
## [**_Confluence_**](https://www.atlassian.com/pl/software/confluence)
### Pros
* Pro 1

The Confluence Quickstart Menu seems to be quite a useful source of information for beginners.

* Pro 2

Things such as where to edit particular settings (like, for example, language and time zone) are nicely explained.

* Pro 3

Speaking of languages, there are plenty of them to choose from (including Polish), which is always nice.

* Pro 4

The Confluence search engine is clear and useful.

* Pro 5

Another plus is that there is no pervasive info about payment. I've only encountered it once.

### Cons
* Con 1

The links to the sample pages in the new space welcome screen don't work for me. It could only be my problem, or I've done something wrong, though.

* Con 2
  
At first, it might seem a bit too overwhelming for new users, who aren't used to such apps.

## [**_JIRA_**](https://www.atlassian.com/pl/software/jira)
### Pros
* Pro 1

There are guides, which are useful and informative. Also, they seem to be updated quite often.

* Pro 2

In general, JIRA software support appears to be helpful.

* Pro 3

Obviosuly, it's compatible with Confluence, which is very convenient.
* Pro 4

It's available for the most popular mobile operating systems. I haven't checked how well they work, though.

### Cons
* Con 1

It could be (mostly visually) too similar to Confluence, which might confuse new users - that was the case with me at first.
* Con 2

The filter function is a bit confusing to me.

## [**_MadCap Flare_**](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/)
### Pros
* Pro 1

There is a chatbot, which functions quite well and should answer most simple questions.

* Pro 2

There is plenty of tutorial films.

* Pro 3

The _Get Started_ menu is informative.

* Pro 4

The interface is nicely explained.

### Cons
* Con 1

At least in my experience, there seems to be quite a lot of information on payment, which might annoy some people.

![](/cash.png)
* Con 2

Some of the tutorial films feature too much of the talking guy and are unnecessarily long - they could be shortened or split into two.

![](/disc.png)
* Con 3

Some instructions are too wordy for my liking - maybe they could get shortened somehow (or presented in a neater way).
